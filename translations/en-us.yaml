    description: "Ever since LinkedIn has introduced the #OpenToWork / #OpenToHireoverlays for people's avatars, this feature started living a life of it's own. While some petty humans advise against using this feature, others take it to another level and own it. Sadly this feature is severely limited and apart from work/hire user has no say in customising the message.  And I think that's sad. So I built this little app for everyone to use and create their custom made #OpenTo... banners."

    description: "There’s been a lot of discourse about how the hashtag #OpenToWork banner puts off recruiters and hiring managers, because it makes you come across as desperate. Frankly, as a victim of redundancy, I am desperate, and I don’t think that’s anything to be ashamed of. Being laid off doesn’t reflect a lack of skills, talent or work ethic - it’s just bad luck. No one should be embarrassed that they need to pay their rent and bills, support their family, or feed themselves. Wear your hashtag #OpenToWork banner with pride, because to me, it just shows that you’re strong, resilient and optimistic - qualities any employer would be lucky to find."
