# #OpenTo...

Ever since [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) has [introduced](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a507508/let-recruiters-know-you-re-open-to-work?lang=en) the `#OpenToWork` / `#OpenToHire`overlays for people's avatars, this feature started living a life of it's own. While some petty humans advise against using this feature, others [take it to another level](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtneysummer_desperate-opentowork-opentowork-activity-7241410975193513984-vexX/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and own it.

Sadly this feature is severely limited and apart from work/hire user has no say in customising the message.

And I think that's sad. So I built this little app for everyone to use and create their custom made `#OpenTo...` banners. Currently one can chose:

- Custom message. E.g: `#OpenToFun!`
- Starting gradient colour
- Stopping gradient colour
- Crop to circle / square
- Background color
- Text offset

The app is deployed on: https://open-to-dot-dot-dot.pudr.com
